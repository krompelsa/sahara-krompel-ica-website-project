                <p>During this experience guests will meet Frankie, a 75-year-old Galapagos tortoise. You will be able to see, feed, and touch Frankie along with his family and friends. Some are shy, while others are more interactive with their keepers, stretching up for a neck rub or eating right out of their hand. Tortoises are attracted to the colors found in flowers, a favorite food—reds, yellows, pinks, and oranges. Try wearing your brightest clothing and see if you get the attention of a Galapagos tortoise!</p>
