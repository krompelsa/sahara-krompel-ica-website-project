                <p>We're excited to welcome the wonderful little fennec fox, Barclay, to our Zoo. Barclay only weighs 2 pounds and measures 14 inches in length. In the wild fennec foxes live in the deserts of North Africa. They have thick fur which helps to regulate their body temperature during the hot days and cold nights of the desert. Barclay has a tiny nose, reddish cream fur, and jet-black eyes. But his most noticeable feature is his enormous ears. These ears help him to dispel the desert heat and locate prey. Barclay spends much of the day underground in his burrow. But he is often seen zipping around the exhibit looking for bugs to eat. We encourage you to come see Barcley in his new home at the African Exhibit.</p>
